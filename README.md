## Hey Fili! ðŸ˜„

### Here I send you a really basic JavaScript exercise.The goal here is not the javascript.The main intention is that you receive and accept the invitation to join the project, clone the project in your local machine,create a feature branch, push your branch and after solving the excercise you request for a pull (pull request) and finally after the feature branch is approved and merged, you delete your feature branch from the project. :grinning:

### The instructions are commented on the .js file however I put them down here just in case yopu want to give ot a look. Here it is:

#### Create a function that takes an array of numbers and return both the minimum and maximum numbers, in that order.

```Create a function that takes an array of numbers and return both the minimum and maximum numbers, in that order.

Examples
minMax([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) âžž [1, 5]

minMax([2334454, 5]) âžž [5, 2334454]

minMax([1]) âžž [1, 1]
```

_hear you soon dude!_
